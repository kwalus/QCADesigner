<h2>Bistable Simulation Engine</h2>
<p>The bistable simulation engine assumes that each cell is a simple two-state system. For this two-state system, it has been shown that the following Hamiltonian can be constructed<a href="#1">[1]</a>.

<p><center><img src="images/two_state_hamiltonian.png"></center>

<p>where <i>E<sup>k</sup><sub>i,j</sub></i> is the kink energy between cell <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>. This kink energy is associated with the energy cost of two cells having opposite polarization. <i>P<sub>j</sub></i> is the polarization of cell <i>j</i>. <i>&gamma;</i> is the tunneling energy of electrons within the cell. The summation is over all cells within an <a href="#radius_of_effect">effective radius</a> of cell <i>i</i>, and can be set prior to the simulation. Using the time-independent Schroedinger equation we are able to find the stationary states of the cell in the environment described by this Hamiltonian. QCADesigner uses the Jacobi algorithm to find the eigenvalues (<i>E<sub>i</sub></i>) and eigenvectors (<i>&psi;<sub>i</sub></i>) of the Hamiltonian

<p><center><img src="images/shroedinger_equation.png"></center>

<p>where <i>H<sub>i</sub></i> is the Hamiltonian given above. <i>&psi;<sub>i</sub></i> is the state vector of the cell. <i>E<sub>i</sub></i> is the energy associated with the state. The algorithm sorts each of the states, <i>&psi;<sub>i</sub></i> , according to their respective energy, in ascending order. The first state in the sorted list is that which has the lowest energy. Our assumption is that the system remains very close to the ground state during computation. As a result, the state with the lowest energy is chosen and the cell polarization is set accordingly. The two state simulation engine computes the polarization of each cell in the design until the entire system has converged to a <a href="#convergence_tolerance">preset tolerance</a>. Once the system has converged, the output values are recorded, new input values are set and the simulation is reiterated.

<p>This method is less time efficient in comparison to the <a href="nonlinear_approximation_engine.html">nonlinear approximation</a>, and as a result leads to longer simulation times. The advantage of this method is that the model on which it is based is more accurate.

<h2>Kink Energy</h2>
<p>The kink energy <i>E<sup>k</sup><sub>i,j</sub></i> represents the energy cost of cells <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> having opposite polarization. It is calculated simply from the electrostatic interaction between all the charges (mobile/immobile). That is, for each dot in cell <i>i</i> we calculate the electrostatic interaction between this dot and each dot in cell <i>j</i> as

<p><center><img src="images/electrostatic_energy.png"></center>

<p>here &epsilon;<sub>0</sub> is the permittivity of free space and &epsilon;<sub>r</sub> is the <a href="#relative_permittivity">relative permittivity</a> of the material system. This is summed over all <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>. To find the kink energy we first compute this electrostatic energy when the cells have opposite polarization, then again when the cells have the same polarization and subtract them.

<p>Because the cell is charge neutral (immobile positive charges cancel the charged electrons) the cells interact through a quadrupole-quadrupole interaction which decays inversely as a power of five of the distance between cells. Therefore the kink energy will decay rapidly with distance and the <a href="#radius_of_effect">effective neighborhood</a> of interacting cells can be made small.

<h2>Engine Options</h2>

<a name="number_of_samples">
<h3>Number of Samples</h3>

<p>The total simulation is divided by the number of samples. For each sample, the simulation engine looks at each cell and calculates its polarization based on the polarization of its effective neighbors (determined by the radius of effect). The larger this number the longer the simulation will take to complete. However, if you choose too small a number you may not get the expected results, because there will not be sufficient samples during input transitions. If you suspect that your results should be something other than what they are, I recommend that you try to increase this number.

<a name="convergence_tolerance">
<h3>Convergence Tolerance</h3>

<p>During each sample, each cell is converged by the simulation engine. The sample will complete when the polarization of each cell has changed by less then this number; i.e. loop while any design cell has (old_polarization - new_polarization) > convergence_tolerance. 

<a name="radius_of_effect">
<h3>Radius of Effect</h3>

<p>Because the interaction effect of one cell onto another decays inversely with the fifth power of the distance between cells, we do not need to consider each cell to affect every other cell. This number determines how far each cell will look to find its neighbors. Make sure that at least the next-to-nearest neighbors are included in this radius. If you only allow for the nearest neighbor then I would not expect designs with coplanar crossovers to work. The following figure should help clear this up.

<p><center><img src="images/radius_of_effect.png"></center>

<a name="relative_permittivity">
<h3>Relative Permittivity</h3>

<p>The relative permittivity of the material system you want to simulate. For GaAs/AlGaAs it is roughly 12.9 which is the default value. This is only used in calculating the kink energy. 

<a name="clock_low">
<a name="clock_high">
<h3>Clock High/Clock Low</h3>

<p>Clock low and high values are tied directly to the tunneling energy in the Hamiltonian. When the clock is high the cell is unlatched. When it is low the cell is latched. The defaults seem to work in most cases, however, you may wish to play with them.

<a name="maximum_iterations_per_sample">
<h3>Maximum Iterations Per Sample</h3>
<p>If the design does not converge in this number of iterations, then the simulation will move on to the next sample point. For complex designs you may wish to increase this.
